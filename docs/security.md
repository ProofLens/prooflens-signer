\# Security \& Threat Model

\- Integrity only (no authenticity of identity unless a cert is used).

\- Attackers who alter bytes will fail verification.

\- Limitations: replacement with a different image + new manifest if not access-controlled.

\- TODO: signatures with real certs; edge-signed manifests.
